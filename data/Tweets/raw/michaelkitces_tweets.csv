If you're growing at 10%, your pattern is:
Year 10: $80k

Being good at advice is different than being good at the thing?

Though that's historically been closer to 35% overhead, 40% advisors, and 25% profits. (More competition for advisors to switch firms and move clients so it drives up the advisor share?)"
1519086032725192707,2022-04-26 22:48:28+00:00,0,0,"@moneyeducator Is that actually your model? Billing hourly and aiming for 1,500 billable hours per year?"
1519085806748639233,2022-04-26 22:47:34+00:00,0,0,"@moneyeducator Yes but still a different skillset to do the job sufficiently depending on revenue.

You'll pay an advisor who bills $600/hour differently than one who bills at $200/hour. Just as the advisor with 80 millionaires gets paid differently than 150 clients w/ $200k."
1519084104435777536,2022-04-26 22:40:48+00:00,0,0,"@moneyeducator Still have to answer the earlier question #2 - how much revenue are they responsible for?

The advisor who services 150 clients with $200k accounts ($300k of revenue) is compensated very differently than the advisor overseeing 80 clients who are millionaires ($800k of revenue)."
1519083808137654273,2022-04-26 22:39:37+00:00,1,0,"@moneyeducator Well, if you don't do a good job, clients say they're not happy with the knowledge/expertise/service received for the fees they pay - even and including hourly fees - and then they don't want to pay, or ask for refund, or don't come back next year for more planning, etc."
1519075820534382592,2022-04-26 22:07:53+00:00,0,0,"@moneyeducator If the advisor is responsible for making sure services are delivered to clients that generate $300k of revenue, doesn't matter much whether the $300k were hourly, subscription, or AUM fees. Firm brought it, advisor has to do the work to support that revenue."
1519075108341563394,2022-04-26 22:05:03+00:00,0,0,@moneyeducator Amount of revenue responsibility is a much bigger driver than the nature of the revenue.
1519074907426111489,2022-04-26 22:04:15+00:00,0,0,@moneyeducator Yes absolutely makes sense. That was where I was going (clearly not clearly!) in separating questions #2 and #3. Existing vs new revenue responsibilities very different!

Or at least they should be - if there are no consequences to losing those clients and revenue that may be problematic long term."
1519068201199579136,2022-04-26 21:37:36+00:00,1,0,"@moneyeducator Depends on the scope of their responsibilities. Do they:
1) Support other advisors and their clients, or have their own clients they are primarily responsible for?
2) If #1 is yes, how much revenue are they responsible for? 
3) Are they accountable for bizdev as well?"
