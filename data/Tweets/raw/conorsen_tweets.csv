1562044780800098307,2022-08-23 11:51:11+00:00,56,8,So a change in the tax code in the early 1980’s incentivized the construction of office buildings. Given trends at the time that meant big-ass towers in CBD’s catering to suburban commuters who needed lots of parking and where nearby amenities didn’t matter. And now here we are.
